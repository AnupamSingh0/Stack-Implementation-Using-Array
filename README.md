# Stack-Implementation-Using-Array
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack.

In this project, I'm going to implement the Stack using Array. 

Some Applications of Stack are:-
1~ Stacks are commonly used in programming languages to manage function calls.
2~ Stacks are used to evaluate expressions, such as arithmetic expressions and nested expressions. They help in    
   maintaining the order of operations and handling parentheses.
3~ Stacks can be used to implement undo and redo functionality in applications. 
4~ Web browsers often use two stacks to keep track of the user's browsing history. One stack stores the forward history 
   (for the "forward" button), and the other stack stores the backward history (for the "back" button).
5~ Many algorithms, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and some sorting algorithms, use stacks as part of 
   their implementation.
